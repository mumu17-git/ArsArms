## **Ars Arms is an integration addon for TaCZ and Ars Nouveau.**

### **Highlights**

*   You can now fire Ars Nouveau spells using TaCZ guns. Since the spells are launched from firearms, they travel faster!
*   To continuously cast spells beyond your current mana level, you can store mana in an ammo box in advance!
*   Ars Nouveau spells are triggered via the _Reactive_ enchantment, so they do not interfere with TaCZ's default firing modes. It's safe to use.

### **How to Use**

    1.  Use the Ars Nouveau enchanting apparatus to apply a **Reactive enchantment** with your desired spell to an **ammo box**.  
        ⚠️ _Note: This can only be done using the Ars Nouveau enchanting apparatus. Additionally, make sure the spell's starting glyph is set to **Touch**._
        
    2.  Insert ammunition into the ammo box.
        
    3.  Hold the ammo box in your off-hand to begin charging it with mana.
        
    4.  While holding the ammo box in your off-hand, reload your gun. The gun will switch to **magic mode**, allowing it to cast spells.
        

### **Notes**

*   The enchantment must be applied using the **Ars Nouveau enchanting apparatus**. Other enchanting methods will not work.
*   The spell you assign must **start with the Touch glyph**. This is required for proper activation.

### **Settings**

*   `damageMultiplier (Default: 0.0)`  
    The damage multiplier for bullets fired from TaCZ guns.  
    _Higher values result in increased damage._
*   `damageAmplifier (Default: 15.0)`  
    The magic damage amplification value for bullets fired from TaCZ guns.  
    _Higher values result in **lower** damage._
